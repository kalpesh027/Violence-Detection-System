Hi! My name is **Kalpesh Ghodekar**. I have created this violence detection, the surveillance system using Python, OpenCv and YOLO 


## How Violence Detection System Work

"In employing YOLO for violence detection, the surveillance system operates through a systematic procedure. Initially, real-time video footage is captured by a camera, serving as input. This video undergoes preprocessing, where YOLO, a deep learning model, efficiently identifies and detects persons within the frames. YOLO directly predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities to identify potential violent actions. Following this analysis, the system determines the presence of violence. Upon detection, the system promptly reports the incident to the nearest station as an abnormal event. Conversely, if no violence is detected, the activity is logged as normal. This meticulous process enables real-time monitoring and response to violent behaviors, thereby enhancing public safety and facilitating swift intervention."

#### What is YOLO
You Only Look Once (YOLO) proposes using an end-to-end neural network that makes predictions of bounding boxes and class probabilities all at once. It differs from the approach taken by previous object detection algorithms, which repurposed classifiers to perform detection.

#### Model training on custom dataset

Experimental results show YOLOv8's performance on customized datasets, assessing metrics like mAP, recall, and precision. Precision measures true positive detections among all model detections, recall measures true positives among all actual positives. mAP provides a single score summarizing overall detection performance.
